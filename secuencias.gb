Summary: Mammalian mitochondrial ribosomal proteins are encoded by
nuclear genes and help in protein synthesis within the
mitochondrion. Mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) consist of a
small 28S subunit and a large 39S subunit. They have an estimated
75% protein to rRNA composition compared to prokaryotic ribosomes,
where this ratio is reversed. Another difference between mammalian
mitoribosomes and prokaryotic ribosomes is that the latter contain
a 5S rRNA. Among different species, the proteins comprising the
mitoribosome differ greatly in sequence, and sometimes in
biochemical properties, which prevents easy recognition by sequence
homology. This gene encodes a 39S subunit protein that belongs to
the L1 ribosomal protein family. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008].

the EcoL2 ribosomal protein family. A pseudogene corresponding to
this gene is found on chromosome 12q. Alternative splicing results
in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms.
[provided by RefSeq, Jul 2014].
Transcript Variant: This variant (2) lacks an exon in the 3' coding
region, which results in a frameshift and an early stop codon,
compared to variant 1. The encoded isoform (2) has a shorter and
distinct C-terminus, compared to isoform 1.

Summary: Mammalian mitochondrial ribosomal proteins are encoded by
nuclear genes and help in protein synthesis within the
mitochondrion. Mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) consist of a
small 28S subunit and a large 39S subunit. They have an estimated
75% protein to rRNA composition compared to prokaryotic ribosomes,
where this ratio is reversed. Another difference between mammalian
mitoribosomes and prokaryotic ribosomes is that the latter contain
a 5S rRNA. Among different species, the proteins comprising the
mitoribosome differ greatly in sequence, and sometimes in
biochemical properties, which prevents easy recognition by sequence
homology. This gene encodes a 39S subunit protein that belongs to
the EcoL15 ribosomal protein family. A pseudogene corresponding to
this gene is found on chromosome 15q. [provided by RefSeq, Jul
2008].

Summary: This nuclear gene encodes a protein component of the
larger 39S subunit of mitochondrial ribosome. This protein may also
aid in the import of nuclear-encoded 5S rRNA into mitochondria.
Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, most
of which are not predicted to encode a protein. A pseudogene of
this gene is found on chromosome 16. [provided by RefSeq, Jan
2016].
Transcript Variant: This variant (2) uses an alternate splice site
in the 3' coding region, which results in a frameshift, compared to
variant 1. The encoded isoform (2) has a shorter, distinct
C-terminus compared to isoform 1.

this gene is found on chromosome 4q. Two transcript variants
encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

Summary: Mammalian mitochondrial ribosomal proteins are encoded by
nuclear genes and help in protein synthesis within the
mitochondrion. Mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) consist of a
small 28S subunit and a large 39S subunit. They have an estimated
75% protein to rRNA composition compared to prokaryotic ribosomes,
where this ratio is reversed. Another difference between mammalian
mitoribosomes and prokaryotic ribosomes is that the latter contain
a 5S rRNA. Among different species, the proteins comprising the
mitoribosome differ greatly in sequence, and sometimes in
biochemical properties, which prevents easy recognition by sequence
homology. This gene encodes a 39S subunit protein. The gene is
biallelically expressed, despite its location within a region of
imprinted genes on chromosome 11. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008].

splicing results in multiple transcript variants. Pseudogenes
corresponding to this gene are found on chromosomes 6p and 12p.

Summary: Mammalian mitochondrial ribosomal proteins are encoded by
nuclear genes and help in protein synthesis within the
mitochondrion. Mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) consist of a
small 28S subunit and a large 39S subunit. They have an estimated
75% protein to rRNA composition compared to prokaryotic ribosomes,
where this ratio is reversed. Another difference between mammalian
mitoribosomes and prokaryotic ribosomes is that the latter contain
a 5S rRNA. Among different species, the proteins comprising the
mitoribosome differ greatly in sequence, and sometimes in
biochemical properties, which prevents easy recognition by sequence
homology. This gene encodes a 39S subunit protein. Sequence
analysis identified three transcript variants. Pseudogenes
corresponding to this gene are found on chromosomes 6p, 10q, and
Xp. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008].
Transcript Variant: This variant (1) is the predominant transcript
and encodes isoform a.

Summary: Mammalian mitochondrial ribosomal proteins are encoded by
nuclear genes and help in protein synthesis within the
mitochondrion. Mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) consist of a
small 28S subunit and a large 39S subunit. They have an estimated
75% protein to rRNA composition compared to prokaryotic ribosomes,
where this ratio is reversed. Another difference between mammalian
mitoribosomes and prokaryotic ribosomes is that the latter contain
a 5S rRNA. Among different species, the proteins comprising the
mitoribosome differ greatly in sequence, and sometimes in
biochemical properties, which prevents easy recognition by sequence
homology. This gene encodes a 39S subunit protein. This gene and
the gene for a semaphorin class 4 protein (SEMA4G) overlap at map
location 10q24.31 and are transcribed in opposite directions.
Sequence analysis identified multiple transcript variants encoding
at least four different protein isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Jul
2008].
Transcript Variant: This variant (5) uses an alternate splice site
in the 3' coding region, compared to variant 1. The encoded isoform
(e) has a longer and distinct C-terminus, compared to isoform a.

Summary: Mammalian mitochondrial ribosomal proteins are encoded by
nuclear genes and help in protein synthesis within the
mitochondrion. Mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) consist of a
small 28S subunit and a large 39S subunit. They have an estimated
75% protein to rRNA composition compared to prokaryotic ribosomes,
where this ratio is reversed. Another difference between mammalian
mitoribosomes and prokaryotic ribosomes is that the latter contain
a 5S rRNA. Among different species, the proteins comprising the
mitoribosome differ greatly in sequence, and sometimes in
biochemical properties, which prevents easy recognition by sequence
homology. This gene encodes a 39S subunit protein. Pseudogenes
corresponding to this gene are found on chromosomes 4p and 21q.

Summary: The protein encoded by this gene is a peptidyl-tRNA
hydrolase and a vital component of the large mitochondrial
ribosome. The encoded protein serves as a ribosome release factor
for this ribosome, which translates mitochondrial genes. This
protein may be responsible for degrading prematurely-terminated
polypeptides and for reusing stalled ribosomes. Two transcript
variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.
[provided by RefSeq, Dec 2014].
Transcript Variant: This variant (1) represents the longer
transcript and encodes the predominant isoform (1).
